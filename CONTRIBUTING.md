## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Blue-Collar.git
   cd Blue-Collar
   pnpm install
   ```

   > **pnpm is the only supported package manager.** This repo uses
   > `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and the `packageManager` field in `package.json`
   > enforces `pnpm@10.32.1`. Running `npm install` or `yarn install` will
   > fail. Install pnpm with `npm install -g pnpm` or via
   > [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) (`corepack enable`).
   > The canonical lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml` — never commit
   > `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.

2. Install git hooks (runs automatically on `pnpm install`, but run manually if needed):
   ```bash
   pnpm prepare
   ```

3. Create a feature branch (see [Branch Naming](#branch-naming)).

4. Make your changes, commit using the [convention below](#commit-message-convention), and open a PR.

## Commit Message Convention

This project uses **Conventional Commits** to power automated changelog generation via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type       | When to use                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                            |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                               |
| `i18n`     | Translations and localization                            |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature  |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                 |
| `chore`    | Build process, dependency updates, tooling               |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes                              |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                                 |

### Scopes (optional but encouraged)

`api`, `app`, `contracts`, `deps`, `ci`, `docs`, `sdk`, `types`, `monitoring`, `mobile`

### Enforcing with commitlint and husky

This project uses [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce the conventional commit format on every commit. The git hook is managed by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

- **Local hook**: A `commit-msg` hook is installed via `pnpm prepare` (runs automatically after `pnpm install`). It validates every commit message against the rules in `commitlint.config.js` before allowing the commit.
- **Manual check**: Run `pnpm commitlint` to validate the last commit message, or `npx commitlint --edit <file>` to validate a specific message file.
- **CI**: The `Commit Lint` workflow re-checks every commit in a pull request, so messages that bypass the local hook (`--no-verify`, commits made in the GitHub web UI, or a clone where `pnpm install` was never run) still fail the PR. It is a required check, not advisory.
- **PR title**: Pull requests are squash merged, so the PR title becomes the commit subject on `main`. It is linted by the same rules and must follow the convention too.

If a commit is rejected with a commitlint error, fix the message and re-commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "feat(sdk): description that follows the convention"
```

### Examples

```
feat(api): add Google OAuth 2.0 login
fix(api): return 409 on duplicate email registration
docs(contracts): add full interface documentation
chore(deps): bump prisma to 7.2.0
test(api): add edge cases for worker toggle endpoint
refactor(api): extract payment logic into service layer
ci: add release-please workflow
```

### Breaking Changes

Append `!` after the type/scope, or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat(api)!: rename /workers/mine to /workers/curator

BREAKING CHANGE: clients must update the endpoint path.
```

## Release Notes

This repository uses `release-please` to generate `CHANGELOG.md` from Conventional Commits.
Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` manually; use the commit convention above and let the release workflow update the changelog on merge.

## Branch Naming

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feat/google-oauth`
- `fix/worker-toggle-auth`
- `docs/contracts-readme`
- `chore/bump-prisma`

## Issue & PR Templates

This repository provides structured templates for issues and pull requests:

| Template | File | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Bug Report | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` | Reporting a bug |
| Feature Request | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` | Suggesting a new feature |
| Documentation | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yml` | Documentation issues or improvements |
| Pull Request | `.github/pull_request_template.md` | Opening a new PR |

Fill in all relevant sections. The templates include checklists specific to the type of change so reviewers can verify compliance quickly.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all CI checks pass (`pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `cargo clippy`).
2. Run the `packages/app` coverage check locally (see [Coverage](#coverage)) and paste the summary into the PR description.
3. Write a clear PR title following the commit convention (release-please uses it).
4. Reference the related issue: `Closes #123`.
5. Request a review from a maintainer.
6. Squash-merge is preferred to keep history clean.

---

## Code Style

### API (TypeScript)

- 2-space indent, double quotes
- Run `pnpm build` to catch type errors before pushing
- Run `pnpm test` to ensure no regressions
- All input validation schemas live in `src/validations/`. Do not create a separate `validators/` directory — add new Zod schemas as a file there and re-export them from `src/validations/index.ts`.

### Contracts (Rust)

- Run `make fmt` before committing
- Run `make clippy` — zero warnings policy

### App (Next.js)

See [packages/app/CONTRIBUTING.md](./packages/app/CONTRIBUTING.md) for frontend-specific conventions.

## Error Handling & Logging

Both packages follow a single written standard: **[docs/ERROR_HANDLING_AND_LOGGING.md](./docs/ERROR_HANDLING_AND_LOGGING.md)**.
Read it before adding an error path or a log line. In short:

- **API:** throw `AppError` with an explicit `ErrorCode` and let the global `errorHandler` format the
  response. Do not add new `try/catch` blocks in controllers that build their own JSON, and do not
  add new callers of `handleError` or `sendError` — both drop `errorCode` and `traceId`.
- **API logging:** use `createServiceLogger(name)` from `utils/logger.js`. Pass structured fields as
  the first argument and the message as the second. No `console.*` in application code. 4xx logs at
  `warn` or below; only 5xx logs at `error`.
- **Correlation IDs:** the OpenTelemetry trace ID is the correlation ID. Read it with `getTraceId()`;
  never invent a per-request UUID. Work that leaves the request context (queues, workers) must carry
  `traceId` in its payload.
- **App:** render `parseApiError(err).message` from `lib/errors.ts` — never a raw thrown message —
  and branch on `code`/`retryable`, not on message text.
- **Never log PII:** no bodies, headers, tokens, emails, or IP addresses.

The document ends with a [review checklist](./docs/ERROR_HANDLING_AND_LOGGING.md#review-checklist);
reviewers are expected to use it. `packages/api/src/__tests__/error-logging-conventions.test.ts`
fails the build if the document and the code disagree.

## Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test          # run all package test suites
pnpm test --filter api   # run a single package
```

---

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

The primary revenue-critical flow — **post job → hire worker → fund escrow → release payment** — is
covered by a browser-driven [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) suite in `packages/app/e2e/`.
The suite drives the real `packages/app` UI against a running `packages/api` and its dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (for `docker-compose.test.yml`)
- Node.js and `pnpm`
- Playwright browsers installed once per machine:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter app exec playwright install --with-deps
  ```

### Run the suite locally (single command)

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

This command stands up the dependencies defined in `docker-compose.test.yml`, waits for the API to
become healthy, runs the Playwright suite against the local stack, and tears the stack down again.

### Useful variants

```bash
pnpm test:e2e -- --ui          # interactive Playwright UI mode
pnpm test:e2e -- --headed      # watch the browser run
pnpm test:e2e -- job-payment   # run a single spec by name
```

### What the happy-path spec covers

`packages/app/e2e/job-payment.spec.ts` walks the full flow end to end:

1. A client signs in and posts a job.
2. The client hires a worker for that job.
3. The client funds escrow for the agreed amount.
4. The client releases payment once the work is marked complete.
5. The test asserts the job and payment reach their terminal success states.

If the suite fails, the Playwright HTML report is written to `packages/app/playwright-report/`.

Each `components/ui` primitive is snapshotted in its key states — **default**, **hover**,
**disabled**, and **error** — so a regression in any single state fails the run.

## Coverage

`packages/app` enforces an **85% line-coverage target** configured in the app's test tooling
(`packages/app/vitest.config.ts`), with per-directory reporting enabled so gaps are visible by area.

### Required local pre-merge check

Before opening or updating a PR that touches `packages/app`, run the coverage check locally and
paste the summary into the PR description:

```bash
pnpm --filter app test:coverage
```
