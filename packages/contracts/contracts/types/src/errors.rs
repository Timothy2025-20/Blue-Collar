//! Shared error definitions for BlueCollar contracts.
//!
//! Consolidates common error codes across all contracts to ensure consistency
//! and maintainability. This is the **single** error enum for the workspace —
//! no contract crate should declare its own `#[contracterror]` enum. An audit
//! of every crate under `packages/contracts/contracts` (issue #1354)
//! confirmed all contracts (registry, job_registry, escrow, payment, market,
//! reputation, dispute, insurance_pool, fee_distribution) already compose
//! errors from this module rather than defining local duplicates, so no
//! per-contract error enums exist to migrate away from.
//!
//! ## Known near-duplicate variants (pre-existing, kept for ABI stability)
//!
//! A handful of variants overlap in meaning because they were added by
//! different contracts before this module existed as the single source of
//! truth. Their discriminants are part of the deployed contract ABI, so they
//! are documented here rather than removed/renumbered:
//!
//! - [`ContractError::NotAuthorized`] is the **canonical** "caller is not
//!   permitted to perform this action" error. Prefer it in new code.
//! - [`ContractError::Unauthorized`] and [`ContractError::UnauthorizedCaller`]
//!   are legacy synonyms kept only because existing deployed contracts /
//!   client SDK bindings reference their numeric codes (6 and 7). Do not use
//!   them in new entrypoints.
//! - [`ContractError::AmountMustBePositive`] is canonical;
//!   [`ContractError::AmountMustBePositiveAlt`] is a legacy synonym kept for
//!   the same ABI-stability reason.
//!
//! New contracts/entrypoints must use the canonical variant. Do not add
//! further synonyms — if an existing variant does not fit, add a new,
//! precisely-named one instead.
