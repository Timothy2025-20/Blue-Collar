/**
 * Horizon Poller job — issue #1235
 *
 * The Horizon polling loop was previously managed by a recursive
 * `setTimeout` inside `startHorizonPoller()` in
 * `services/horizon-poller.service.ts`.  That function is preserved for
 * backward compatibility but the lifecycle management is now delegated here.
 *
 * The poller fetches Stellar contract events every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (30s),
 * ingests them into the database, and dispatches to webhook subscribers.
 * The underlying fetch logic stays in the service; this module only handles
 * scheduling concerns (start, stop, logging, concurrency guard).
