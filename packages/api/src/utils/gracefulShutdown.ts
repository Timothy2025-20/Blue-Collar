 * Graceful worker shutdown — Issue #1352

 * finish (or are safely left for another worker to pick back up) before the
 * process exits. BullMQ workers already requeue jobs that are still locked
 * when a worker disconnects, so the main job here is to stop pulling new
 * work and wait for the currently-running job(s) to settle within a bounded
 * timeout instead of exiting immediately.
