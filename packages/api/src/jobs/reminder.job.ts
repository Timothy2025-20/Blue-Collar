 * Reminder job — issue #1235

 * Wraps `runVerificationReminderJob` from the reminder service in a

 *
 * Previously the `setInterval` call lived inside `startReminderScheduler()`
 * in services/reminder.service.ts.  That function is preserved for backward
 * compatibility but now delegates to this module.
